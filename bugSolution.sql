The solution involves careful attention to data types.  Use VARCHAR for text data and appropriate numeric types (INT, DECIMAL, etc.) for numerical data. Ensure all columns not aggregated in a query are present in the GROUP BY clause to avoid ambiguity and unexpected results. For example: -- Incorrect Query SELECT customerID, COUNT(*) FROM Orders GROUP BY customerID; -- Correct Query SELECT customerID, COUNT(*) FROM Orders GROUP BY customerID;  This ensures that the query returns a count of orders for each unique customerID.
