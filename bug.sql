In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column. For example, using an INT when a VARCHAR is needed, which might lead to unexpected behavior or data truncation. Another issue arises when selecting columns not specified in the GROUP BY clause but using aggregate functions.  This often causes errors that aren't immediately apparent and might lead to incorrect results.
